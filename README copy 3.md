## Details

- Approx. completion time: **2 hours—in class**
- Deliverables: **3 HTML files, 4 CSS files, images**

Using the modular CSS patterns, recreate the layouts matching the attached screenshots.

1. Create a new CSS file named `modules.css` and include the following items from [Modulifier »](http://modulifier.web-dev.tools/#responsive;images;list-group;embed;media-object;buttons;forms;accessibility;print) in it: responsive setup, images, list group, embed containers, media objects, basic buttons, forms, accessibility & print styles. *Make sure `modules.css` is the first CSS file, the order should be: `modules`, `grids`, `type`.*
2. Delete anything from your `main.css` that’s duplicated by Modulifier.
3. Add embed containers around all the images.
4. Add list groups to all of the `<dl>` tags so they become more responsive.
5. Add the new content to the moons page using grids, typography & modules (use media objects for the “Probes” section, the images don’t need embed containers).
6. Add the new footer to the pages, using grids, typography & list groups.
